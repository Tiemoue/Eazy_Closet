## Overview
### Description
A closet App that recommeds clothing items to wear based on the weather in the users location

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** lifestyle / health
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes the current weather and the clothes in the user closet and then suggest what peice of clothing to wear and items to carry.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often especially if the individual is working.
- **Scope:** First we would let the user input the clothing items he/she owns and then we use a weather api with that geolocation to suggest a clothing items based on the weather.
